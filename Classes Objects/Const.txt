const Member Functions & const Class Objects
• Constant member functions are those functions that are denied permission to change the values of the data members of their class
• the keyword “const” is appended to the function prototype and also to the function definition header.
• the objects of a class can also be declared as const.
• Any attempt to change the data member of const objects results in a compile-time error.
• Constant object can only call constant members.
• When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object
• Non-const functions can only be called by non-const objects.
• Constant objects are initialized at the time of decleration using constructor
